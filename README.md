## Getting Started

## Here are the guidelines for running the Flutter project:

1. *Setup Environment*: 
Ensure that you have Flutter SDK installed on your system and set up the development environment for your preferred IDE (like Android Studio, VS Code, etc.).

2. *Project Cloning*: 
Clone the Flutter project repository from the version control system (like GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.) to your local machine using Git.

3. *Dependencies Installation*: 
Navigate to the project directory and run flutter pub get to install all the dependencies listed in the pubspec.yaml file.

4. *Configuration*: 
Check if there are any configuration files (like firebase.json, google-services.json, etc.) required for third-party services integration and configure them accordingly.

5. *Device Setup*: 
Ensure that you have either an Android or iOS device connected to your development machine or set up an emulator/simulator to run the Flutter app.

6. *Run Application*: 
Use the command flutter run in the terminal or click on the run button in your IDE to compile and run the Flutter application on the connected device or emulator(Ensure USB debugging is enabled on your device).

7. *To create Apk*: 
 Use the command flutter build apk --release to create an APK file. You can locate this APK file in build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk. You can then install this APK file on Android devices.Alternatively, you can connect your Android device to your laptop or PC. Ensure USB debugging is enabled on your device. Then, run the command flutter install to install the app directly onto your device.
